The proxy service has been configured to use the same and the model is referenced in the code throughout this notebook by passing the 'model' parameter as 'phi3' to openai client completion calls. The proxy service runs on localhost port 4000 by default and has been referenced as the 'base_url' for openai client objects. The master key for LLM Gateway has been set as \"sk-password\" and can be used for calling registered models as well as accessing the admin panel at \"https://<CODESPACE_NAME>-4000.app.github.dev/ui\". The same can be accessed through port 4000 on the PORTS tab of the terminal."
